Hi, I'm Olabode (O-lah-boh-dey) Anise (Uh-nee-shey), and I am a Data Scientist at [Duo Security](https://duo.com/). At Duo, my work mostly centers around making data accessible to different parts of the business and trying to help others understand how our product is being used. Above all, I enjoy work that centers around understanding humans and their mental models. This has led me to my interests in Usable Security and Human-Centered Machine Learning.

When I'm not at work, I like to read, play basketball or kickball, and watch the Steelers, Auburn Tigers and Phoenix Suns.
